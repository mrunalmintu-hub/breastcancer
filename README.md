Detecting Breast Cancer Through Data and Deep Learning

Every image tells a story.

In this project, that story is hidden inside thousands of microscopic breast cell images — patterns invisible to the human eye but meaningful to a machine trained to see them.

This notebook walks through the complete journey of transforming raw image data into an intelligent classification model capable of distinguishing between different breast cancer classes.

It begins with raw .npy image files — unstructured arrays of pixels.
From there, we explore the data visually and statistically, uncovering patterns through:

Class distribution analysis

Feature variance exploration

Correlation mapping

Dimensionality reduction with PCA

Visual inspection of sample cell images

As the data reveals its structure, we carefully prepare it — normalizing pixel values, encoding labels, and addressing class imbalance using calculated class weights.

Then comes the core of the project: building and training a machine learning / deep learning model that learns to interpret these complex patterns.

The goal isn’t just accuracy — it’s understanding how data, mathematics, and neural networks can work together to support medical diagnosis.

This project represents more than a classification task.
It’s a demonstration of how data science can transform raw biomedical images into actionable insights.
